Chapter 29: Fiscal Policy
=========================

* **fiscal policy**: government policies to achieve macroeconomic objectives (i.e low unemployment, GDP growth, stable inflation rate)
* responsibility of minister of Finance

* **federal budget**: annual statement of gvmt.'s outlays/revenues
* finances gvmt. activities, used to achieve macroeconomic goals
* fiscal policy makes use of the federal budget

* minister of finance presents budget to Parliament
* Parliament debates law, enacts necessary laws

* budget deficit not necessarily bad; if extra expenditure invested (increase GDP), can be beneficial

Supply-side Effects of Fiscal Policy
====================================

* fiscal policies affect employment, potential GDP, aggregate supply: **supply-side effects**
* **full employment and potential GDP**: see diagrams in slides

* taxes on consumption expenditure add to tax wedge

Taxes and Incentive to Save and Invest
========================================

* capital income tax lowers savings quantity, slows growth of real GDP
* interest rate that influence saving/investment is **real after-tax** interest rate
* real after-tax interest rate subtracts income tax paid on interest income from real interest
* taxes depend on nominal interest rate; true tax depends on inflation rate
* real tax rate much higher than nominal

Tax Revenue and the Laffer Curve
=================================

* relationship between tax rate and amount of tax revenue: **Laffer curve**
* see diagram in slides

Fiscal Stimulus
===============

* **fiscal stimulus**: use of fiscal policy to increase production/employment
* **automatic fiscal policy**: fiscal policy action triggered by state of economy with no government action
* **discretionary fiscal policy**: policy action initiated by act of Parliament

Auto. Fiscal Pol. and Cyclical and Structural Budget Balances
==============================================================

* two items in gvmt. budget change automatically: tax revenues, transfer payments

* **structural surplus or deficit**: budget balance that would occur if economy were at full employment and real GDP were equal to potential GDP
* **cyclical surplus or deficit**: actual surplus or deficit - structural surplus or deficit

Discretionary Fiscal Stim.
=========================

* changes in gvmt. expenditure and taxes change aggregate demand/have multiplier effects: gvmt expenditure multiplier, tax multiplier
* **government expenditure multiplier**: quantity effect of a change in government expenditure on real GDP
* + gvmt. expenditure => + real GDP => + income, + consumption expenditure => aggregate demand + => multiplier > 1
* but + in gvmt expenditure also increase gvmt. borrowing => raises real interest rate => - investment => multiplier less than 1
* which wins? consensus: **crowding-out effect** wins, multiplier less than 1

* **tax multiplier**: quantity effect a change in taxes on aggregate demand
* demand-side effects of tax cut likely smaller than increase in gvmt. expenditure

Time Lags
==========

* **recognition lag**: time taken to see than fiscal policy action needed
* **law-making lag**: time taken for Parliament to pass laws needed
* **impact lag**: time taken from passing tax or spending change to its actual effect on real GDP
