Chapter 26: Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand
=================================================

Intro
----
* long-run, GDP growth
* short run, fluctuates about trend
* __recession__: falling real incomes/rising unemployment 
* __depression__: extreme recession
* __business cycles__: short-term fluctuations

* __model of aggregate demand/aggregate supply__: used to study fluctuations
* __classical economics__: classical dichotomy, neutrality of money

Aggregate Supply
----------------
* aggregate supply/demand: no chance for substitution(all goods already included)

* __quantity of Real GDP supplied__: total quantity that firms plan to produce during given period
* aggregate supply relationship between GDP supplied and price level

Long-Run Aggregate supply
-------------------------
* relationship between quantity of real GDP supplied and the price when real GDP = potential GDP
* potential GDP independent of price level
* long-run aggregate supply curve (LAS) vertical at potential GDP

Short-run aggregate supply
--------------------------
* __sticky wage theorem__: price level changes, but wages take time to change (i.e wage set by contract for time period); lower price level, firm must keep paying higher wage, so reduce output; higher price level, firm keeps paying lower wage, output increase but employee purchasing power reduce

* __stick price theorem__: price level changes, but prices take time to change

* __misperception theorem__: mistaking change in overall price level for a relative change (i.e. change in price of coffee, assume price relative to another good changes, but fail to realize other good's price has changed as well)

* factors that shift LAS also shift SAS (short-run aggregate supply) (i.e. changes in potential GDP)
* change in __expected price level__: expect higher price level, negotiate higher wage: cost of production increase, SAS moves left

Aggregate Demand
----------------
* __quantity of real GDP demanded__: total amount of final goods/services produced in Canada that people/businesses/gmvm/foreigners plan to buy
* Y = C + I + G + X - M

* __wealth effect__: relationship between price level and C
* __interest rate effect__: relationship between price level and I

Substitution effects
--------------------
* rise in price level decrease real value of money, increase interest rate
* people choose to save, put off purchases until later

International substitution effect
--------------------------------
* rise in price level => increase price of domestic goods relative to foreign goods
* imports increase, exports decrease, decrease in demand in real GDP

Short run macroeconomic Equilibrium
-----------------------------------
* quantity of real GDP demanded equals quantity of real GDP supplied at point of intersection of AD with SAS

Long-term macroeconomic Equilibrium
-------------------------------
* occurs when real GDP = potential GDP; economy is on its LAS curve
* occurs at intersection of AD and LAS
