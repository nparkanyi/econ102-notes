Chapter 26: Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand
=================================================

Intro
----
* long-run, GDP growth
* short run, fluctuates about trend
* __recession__: falling real incomes/rising unemployment 
* __depression__: extreme recession
* __business cycles__: short-term fluctuations

* __model of aggregate demand/aggregate supply__: used to study fluctuations
* __classical economics__: classical dichotomy, neutrality of money

Aggregate Supply
----------------
* aggregate supply/demand: no chance for substitution(all goods already included)

* __quantity of Real GDP supplied__: total quantity that firms plan to produce during given period
* aggregate supply relationship between GDP supplied and price level

Long-Run Aggregate supply
-------------------------
* relationship between quantity of real GDP supplied and the price when real GDP = potential GDP
* potential GDP independent of price level
* long-run aggregate supply curve (LAS) vertical at potential GDP

Short-run aggregate supply
--------------------------
* __sticky wage theorem__: price level changes, but wages take time to change (i.e wage set by contract for time period); lower price level, firm must keep paying higher wage, so reduce output; higher price level, firm keeps paying lower wage, output increase but employee purchasing power reduce

* __stick price theorem__: price level changes, but prices take time to change

* __misperception theorem__: mistaking change in overall price level for a relative change (i.e. change in price of coffee, assume price relative to another good changes, but fail to realize other good's price has changed as well)
