The Economic Problem
====================

Why does food cost much more today than it did a few years ago?
---------------------------------------------------------------
* now use part of our corn crop to produce ethanol, cleaner biofuel
* another reason drought caused decrease in globel grain production


* We use an **economic model**: the __production possibilities frontier__ to learn why ethanol production and drought increase cost of producing food

Our First Model
----------------
* __circular flow diagram__: visual model of the economy, shows dollar flow through markets

* two types of actors: **households** and **firms**
* two markets: market for __goods and services__ and market for __factors of production__

* __factors of production__: resources economy uses to produce goods/services
* diagram: see course slides

* government left out: critical for economy to function (enforce contracts, property rights, etc.)
* imports/exports left out

Our Second Model
----------------

Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)
----------------------------------------
* a graph that combines two goods economy can produce given available resources and available technology

The PPF and Opportunity Cost
----------------------------
* society faces tradeoff: getting more of one good requires sacrificing some of the other
* slope of PPF tells you the __opportunity cost__ of one good in terms of other
* __production efficiency__ achieved at points on the PPF; means you must give up output of one to increase the other
* __point of allocative efficiency__: point on the PPF where production is best allocated based on demand, can no longer produce more of any one good without giving up one we value more highly
* __marginal cost__: oppurtunity cost per unit
* point outside PPF only possible with international trade (other country produces more cheaply, can trade for more than could be produced)

Shape of PPF
------------
* line or bow-shaped
* line => constant opportunity cost
* bow-shape => opportunity cost of good rises as economy produces more of the good

Economy Growth
--------------
* __economic growth__: expansion of production possibilities and increase in living standard
* two factors: technology, capital accumulation
* __technological change__ development of new goods and better ways of producing goods
* __capital accumulation__ growth of capital resources, including human capital
* economic growth not free, does not abolish scarcity 
* opportunity cost: less current consumption
* PPF shifts outward (increase in output of both commodities)
* __unbiased tech. advancement__: contributes equally to both comm.
* __biased__: only contributes output to one comm.

Economists as Policy Advisors
-----------------------------
* as scientists, make __positive statements__, describe world as it is
* as advisors: make __normative statements__, describe what should be
* leads to disagreements
