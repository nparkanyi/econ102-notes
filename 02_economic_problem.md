The Economic Problem
====================

Why does food cost much more today than it did a few years ago?
---------------------------------------------------------------
* now use part of our corn crop to produce ethanol, cleaner biofuel
* another reason drought caused decrease in globel grain production


* We use an *economic model*: the _production possibilities frontier_ to learn why ethanol production and drought increase cost of producing food

Our First Model
----------------
* _circular flow diagram_: visual model of the economy, shows dollar flow through markets

* two types of actors: *households* and *firms*
* two markets: market for _goods and services_ and market for _factors of production_

* _factors of production_: resources economy uses to produce goods/services
* diagram: see course slides

* government left out: critical for economy to function (enforce contracts, property rights, etc.)
* imports/exports left out

Our Second Model
----------------

Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)
----------------------------------------
* a graph that combines two goods economy can produce given available resources and available technology

The PPF and Opportunity Cost
----------------------------
* society faces tradeoff: getting more of one good requires sacrificing some of the other
* slope of PPF tells you the _opportunity cost_ of one good in terms of other
* _production efficiency_ achieved at points on the PPF; means you must give up output of one to increase the other
* _point of allocative efficiency_: point on the PPF where production is best allocated based on demand, can no longer produce more of any one good without giving up one we value more highly
* _marginal cost_: oppurtunity cost per unit

Shape of PPF
------------
* line or bow-shaped
* line => constant opportunity cost
* bow-shape => opportunity cost of good rises as economy produces more of the good

Economy Growth
--------------
* _economic growth_: expansion of production possibilities and increase in living standard
* two factors: technology, capital accumulation
* _technological change_ development of new goods and better ways of producing goods
* _capital accumulation_ growth of capital resources, including human capital
* economic growth not free, does not abolish scarcity
