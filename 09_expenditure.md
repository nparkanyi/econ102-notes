Chapter 27: Expenditure Approach
===================

Fixed prices and expenditure plans
================================

* each firm's price fixed => price level fixed, aggregate demand determines GDP

Expenditure Plans
==================

* components of aggregate expenditure sum to real GDP
* Y = C + I + G + X - M
* C and I influenced by real GDP
* two-way link between real GDP, aggregate expenditure

Consumption and Savings Plans
===========================

* __disposable income__: aggregate income or real GDP minus net taxes (YD)
* disposable income YD = Y - T
* savings function/consumption function (see slides)
* __autonomous consumption__: consumption that does not depend on disposable income (happens regardless)
* __induced consumption__: consumption in excess of autonomous consumption
* when consumption expenditure exceeds disposable income, saving is negative (dissaving)
* when consumption expenditure less than disposable income, saving
* __marginal propensity to consume__: fraction of change in disposable income spent over consumption
* slope of consumption function
* __marginal propensity to save__: slope of savings function
* MPC + MPS = 1

Consumption as a Function of Real GDP
====================================
* if tax rates don't change, real GDP only influence on disposable income
* consumption expenditure function of real GDP

Import Function
==============

* short run: imports influenced by real GDP
* __marginal propensity to import__: increase of real GDP spent on import
* __aggregate planned expenditure__: planned consumption plus planned investment plus planned gvmt expenditure plus planned X - M
* fixed price level, this determines aggregate demand

* __actual aggregate expenditure__: always equal to real GDP
* planned expenditure may differ, unplanned changes in inventories
* __equilibrium expenditure__: level of aggregate expenditure that occurs when planned aggregate expenditure = real GDP

The Multiplier
==============
* when autonomous expenditure changes, so does equilibrium expenditure and real GDP
* __multiplier__: amount by which a change in autonomous expenditure is magnified or multiplied, determining change in expenditure
* size of multiplier: change in equilibrium expenditure divided by change in autonomous expenditure
* multiplier = 1 / (1- slope of AE curve) = 1 / (1 - MPC) = 1 / MPS
* also = change in real GDP / change in autonomous expenditure
* imports and income taxes reduce size of multiplier
