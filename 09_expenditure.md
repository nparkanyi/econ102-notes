Chapter 27: Expenditure Approach
===================

Fixed prices and expenditure plans
================================

* each firm's price fixed => price level fixed, aggregate demand determines GDP

Expenditure Plans
==================

* components of aggregate expenditure sum to real GDP
* Y = C + I + G + X - M
* C and I influenced by real GDP
* two-way link between real GDP, aggregate expenditure

Consumption and Savings Plans
===========================

* __disposable income__: aggregate income or real GDP minus net taxes (YD)
* disposable income YD = Y - T
* savings function/consumption function (see slides)
* __autonomous consumption__: consumption that does not depend on disposable income (happens regardless)
* __induced consumption__: consumption in excess of autonomous consumption
* when consumption expenditure exceeds disposable income, saving is negative (dissaving)
* when consumption expenditure less than disposable income, saving
