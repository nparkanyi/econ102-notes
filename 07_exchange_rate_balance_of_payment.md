Chapter 25: Exchange Rate/Balance of Payments
=============================================

Foreign exchange market
-----------------------

* __foreign exchange market__: currency of one country is exchanged for the currency of another

Exchange rates
-------------
* __foreign exchange rate__: price at which one currency exchanges for another
* __currency depreciation__: fall in value of one currency in terms of another
* __currency appreciation__: increase ''

* foreign exchange market is competitive market, no restrictions

Demand for one money is supply of another
----------------------------------------

* when people want to exchange for CDN, they demand Canadian dollars and supply their country's money

Law of Demand for foreign exchange
----------------------------------

* demand for dollars derived demand
* people buy cdn to buy canadian goods/services

* __exports effect__: larger value of Can. exports, greater the quantity of Canadian dollars demanded
* lower exchange rate => greater value of Canadian exports, greater demand for CDN
* __expected profit effect__: larger expected profit of holding CDN => greater demand of CDN
* expected profit depends on exchange rate
* lower exchange rate => more expected profit => more demand for CDN

Supply in Foreign Exchange Market
---------------------------------

* main factors:
* 1. exchange rate
* 2. canadian demand for imports
* 3. interest rates in canada/elsewhere
* 4. the expected future exchange rate

Law of supply of foreign exchange
--------------------------------

* higher exchage rate => greater quantity of CDN supplied

* __imports effect__: larger imports => larger quantity of CDN supplied
* higher exchange rate => greater value of CDN imports => greater quantity of CDN supplied
* __expected profit effect__: lower current exchange rate => greater expected profit from holding CDN => less supply of CDN

Exchange rate fluctuations
--------------------------
Changes in demand for CDN
-------------------------
* __world demand for canadian exports__: increase in demand for CDN exports => demand for CDN increase
* __canadian interest rate relative to foreign interest rate__: CDN interest rate minus foreign interest rate __Canadian interest rate differential__
* canadian interest increase => demand for CDN increases
* __expected future exchange rate__: expected future exchange rate for CDN increase => demand for CDN increase, demand curve shifts right

Changes is supply for CDN
---------------------------

* __CDN demand for imports__: increase in demand for imports => increase supply of CDN
* __Canadian interest rate relative to foreign interest rate__: differential rises => supply decrease, supply curve move left
* __expected future exchange rate__: expected future exchange rate => supply of CDN decreases, demand curve moves right

Fundamentals, Expectations, Arbitrage
------------------------------------

* exchange rate changes when it is expected to change
* but expectations driven by forces such as:
* interest rate parity
* purchasing power parity

Interest rate parity
---------------------
* __interest rate parity__: rates of return on two currencies equal
* means equal interest rates taking into account exchange rates
* market forces achieve this quickly

Purchasing power parity
-----------------------
* currency worth goods it can buy
* when two quantities of money can buy the same quantity of goods/services, __purchasing power parity__
* means equal __value__ of money

Instant exchange rate response
------------------------------
* exchange rate responds instantly to news about changes in variables that influence demand and supply in foreign exchange market

Real Exchange Rates
------------------
* __real exchange rate__: relative price of Canadian-produced goods/services to foreign-produced goods/services
* measures quantity of real GDP of other countries that a unit of Canadian real GDP buys
* E = nominal exchange rate, RER = real exchange rate
* RER = (E * P)/P'
* P Canadian price level, P' foreign price level

* in short run, RER changes by same amount as E
* in long run, RER is determined by real forces of demand and supply in markets for goods/services
* in long run, E determined by RER and price levels:
* E = RER(P*/P)

Exchange Rate Policy
-------------------
* three possible policies:
* __flexible exchange rate__: permits exchange rate to be determined by demand/supply with no direct intervention by central bank
* __fixed exchanged rate__: pegs exchange rate at a value decided by the government or central bank, achieved by direct intervention in the foregin exchange market, blocking unregulated forces of demand/supply
* requires active intervention
* __crawling peg__: follows a path determined by a decision of the government, active intervention
* China uses crawling peg
* like fixed exchange, but target fluctuates 

Financing International Trade
-----------------------------

* __balance of payment accounts__: records international trading, borrowing, lending
* three balance of payment accounts:
* 1. current account
* 2. capital and financial account
* 3. official settlements account

Current account records
----------------------
* receipts from exports of goods/services sold abroad
* payments for imports of goods/services from abroad
* net interest paid abroad
* net transfers (i.e. foreign aid)
* __current account balance__: exports - imports + net interest income + net transfers

Capital and financial account
-----------------------------
* records foreign investment in Canada - canadian investment abroad

Official Settlements account
----------------------------
* change in canadian official reserves
* __canadian official reserves__: gvmnt. holdings 
* see slides

Balance of Payment must balance
--------------------------------
* sum of current account and capital account balances in any given period
* BoP = CA + KA = 0
* no such thing as balance of payment deficit !

* __debtor nation__: country that has always borrowed more than lent throughout its history (i.e. Canada, United States)
* __creditor nation__: invested more in the rest of world than others invested in them 

Current Account Balance
----------------------
* CAB = NX + Net interest income + net transfers
* NX = net exports
* __government sector surplus or deficit__: equal to net taxes T minus gvmt expenditure on goods/services G
* __private sector surplus/deficit__: saving S minus investment I
* NX = (T - G) + (S - I)

* in short run, decrease nom. exchange rate => real exchange rate => imports more costly, exports more competitive
* long run, real exchange rate unchanged, nominal exchange rate plays no role

Variables influencing net export
-------------------------------
* consumers preferences for foreign/domestic goods
* prices of goods home/abroad
* incomes of consumers at home/abroad
* exchange rates at which foreign currency trades for domestic currency
* transportation costs
* gvmt. policies
