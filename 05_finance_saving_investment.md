Chapter 23: Finance, Saving, and Investment
==========================================

* __Study of finance__: households/firms obtain and use financial resources, and cope w/ the risks
* __study of money__: how households/firms use it, how much they hold, how banks create and manage

* __physical capital__: tools, instruments, machines, etc. produced in past used to produce good/service
* __financial capital__: used to purchase physical capital

* __financial system__: help match savings and investments

Financial Markets
------------------
* __financial markets__: institutions through which savers directly provide funds borrowers 

* __bond market__: **bond** certificate of indebtedness (identifies date of maturity/interest rate)
* duration of bond determines interest rate (longer term -> higher risk -> higher interest rate)
* __perpetuity__: bonds that never mature
* __stock market__: **stock** claim to partial ownership in a firm
* __equity finance__: raising money through stocks
* __debt finance__: raising money through bonds

Financial Intermediaries
------------------------
* __financial intermediaries__: institutions through which savers indirectly provide funds to borrowers
* __banks__: take deposits from people, lend out to others who want to borrow
* __mutual funds__: institutions that sell shares to public, buy portfolios of stocks/bonds

Insolvency and Illiquidity
---------------------------
* __net worth__: total value of what institution lent - market value of what borrowed
* if positive, __solvent__
* if negative, __insolvent__, business can go out of business
* __illiquidity__: inability to pay off borrowings (i.e. 2008 financial crisis)

Interest Rates and Asset Prices
-------------------------------
* __interest rate__: interest payed on an asset expressed as percentage of asset price

Saving and Investment in the National Income Accounts
----------------------------------------------------
* __closed economy__: no trade
* GDP of closed economy: Y = C + I + G
* I = investment
* I = Y - C - G: total income in the economy remaining after paying for consumption and government purchase: __savings__ or __national savings (S)__
* in closed economy, I = S
* T = taxes
* also, S = (Y - T - C) + (T - G)
* __private saving__ (Y - T - C) + __public saving__ (T - G)
* unlike GDP, goverment spending must be included! (transfer payment, employment insurance, etc.)
* private savings: household's income not used for consumption or paying taxes
* public savings: tax revenue - government spending

Budget Deficits and Surpluses
-----------------------------
* __surplus__: excess of tax revenue over gvmt. spending
* __deficit__: shortfall of tax revenue from gvmt. spending

* in __open economy__, I = Prvt. savings + pub. savings + int. borrowing
* I = S + (T - G) + (M - X)

The Market for Loanable Funds
------------------------------
* a supply-demand model
* assume only one financial market
* all savers deposit their savings
* all borrowers take out loans from this market
* supply of loanable funds comes from saving:
* Households with extra income loan it, earn interest
* public saving: positive -> adds to national savings/supply of loanable funds; negative -> reduces national savings and supply of loanable funds

* Supply-demand curve of loanable funds market: supply provided by households/governments, demand from firms/etc. 
Policy 1: Tax Incentives
------------------------
* tax incentives for saving increase supply (increase in **sales** taxes), supply graph moves to the right
* reduces equilibrium interest rate
Policy 2: Investment Incentives
-------------------------------
* investment tax credit increases demand, moves demand curve right, increase equilibrium interest rate

* __crowding out__: decrease in investment resulting from gvmt. borrowing
* reduces economic growth, goes to gvmt. instead of firms
* __vicious circle__: deficits reduce supply of loanable funds, increase interest rate, discourage investment, slower economic growth -> lower tax revenue + higher spending on social programs -> even higher budget deficits 
* __virtuous circle__: surpluses increase supply of loanable funds, etc. -> faster economic growth -> higher tax revenue, lower spending on social programs -> even higher surpluses 

Global Loanable Funds Market
---------------------------
* lenders want highest possible real interest rate; seek it by looking around the world
* borrowers want to pay lowest possible real interest rate and they seek it by looking around the world
