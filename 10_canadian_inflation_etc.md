Chapter 28: Canadian Inflation, Unemployment, Business Cycle
============================================================

Inflation Cycles
----------------

* long-run: inflation when quant. money grows faster than potential GDP

* **demand-pull inflation**: starts from increase in aggregate demand

* **cost-push inflation**: begins with increase in costs
* two main sources: increase in money wage rate, an increase in money price of raw materials

Aggregate Demand Response
--------------------------

* increase in cost creates one-time price-level rise, not inflation
* inflation occurs when aggregate demand increases (i.e Bank of Canada prints money)
* Bank of Canada stimulates agg. demand to oppose higher unemployment

* **stagflation**: combination of rising price level and decreasing real GDP

* **expected inflation**: agg. demand +, but expected, money wage rate rises appropriately

Forecasting Inflation
---------------------

* **rational expectation**: best forecast available based on all available information; not necessarily correct

* if forecast is correct, economy operating at full employment
* agg demand + faster than expected, real GDP above potential GDP, economy behaves as in demand-pull inflation
* agg demand + more slowly, economy behaves as in cost-push inflation

Inflation/Unemployment: The Phillips Curve
------------------------------------------

* **Phillips curve**: shows relationship between inflation rate and unemployment rate
* both short-run and long-run Phillips curves

* **short-run**: curve holds constant expected inflation rate and natural unemployment rate
* **long-run**: determined by natural unemployment rate
