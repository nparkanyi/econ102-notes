Chapter 24: Money, Price Level, Inflation
==========================================

* without __money__, __bartering__
* __double coincidence of wants__: happen upon someone who has what you need and offering what you want
* __money__: commodity/token generally accepted as payment

3 Functions
-----------

* __medium of exchange__
* __unit of account__: metric for posted prices/record debts
* __store of value__: transfer purchase power from present to future

Wealth/Liquidity
----------------

* __wealth__: total of all stores of value (includes non-money assets)
* __liquidity__: ease of converting non-monetary assets

2 Kinds of Money
----------------

* __commodity money__: commodity w/ intrinsic value (gold, cigarettes, etc)
* __fiat money__: without intrinsic value, used by gvmt decree

Money in Canadian Economy
--------------------------

* __money supply/stock__: quantity available in economy
* includes __currency__ and __demand deposits__ (balance in bank accounts)
* currency within a bank not counted as such

Two Measures of Money Stock
--------------------------

* see slides (M1 and M2) defns

* M1 items money; means of payment
* some in M2 not means of payment; liquid assets
* deposits money, cheques not (instructions to a bank)
* credit cards not money; loan

* __banking system__: public/private institutions, create money, manage monetary/payment systems
* Depository institutions and Bank of Canada

Bank of Canada
--------------

* __central bank__: regulates money supply
* __bank of canada__: central bank of canada (est. 1935, nationalized 1938)
* structure: board of directors including deputy minister of Finance
* members appointed by minister of Finance
* __lender of last resort__

4 Primary Functions
---------------------

* issue currency
* banker to commercial banks
* banker to Canadian Gvmt.
* control money supply

* __monetary policy__: decisions about money supply

* __BOC Balance Sheet__: assets gvmt securities and last-resort loans to banks
* liabilities: notes and deposits of banks and gvmt.

Chartered Banks
---------------

* private firm, receive deposits and make loans for profit

Credit Unions/Caisses Populaires
--------------------------------
* co-op organization receive deposits and make loans to its members

* depository institutions maximize wealth of owners
* interest rate it lends exceeds interest rate pays

* deposits into 4 assets:
* __reserves__: note/coins in vault
* __liquid assets__: treasury bills/commercial bills
* __securities__: longterm gvmt. bonds
* __loans__: commitments of money for agreed-upon time

Benefits
--------

* profit
* 4 benefits: liquidity, pool risk, lower cost of borrowing, lower cost of monitoring borrowers

* __monetary base__: BOC notes outside BOC + bank's deposits + coins held outside BOC

Tools of Monetary Ctrl.
-----------------------

* __open market operations__: buying/selling gvmt. bonds
* buying + money supply/ selling - money supply
* __foreign exchange operations__: buys/sells foreign currencies (buys + money supply/ sells - money supply)
* engages to support currency

* __sterilization__: offset foreign exchange market ops w/ open-market ops. => effect on money supply cancelled out

* __change in overnight rate__:
* __bank rate__: interest rate charged by BOC on loans to commercial banks
* commercial banks never need to pay more than bank rate for short-term loans, they can just go to BOC
* never accept less than bank rate (minus half percent), then can lend to BOC instead
* __overnight rate__: rate commercial bank pays to other commercial bank

* __reserve requirement__: minimum amount required by law for commercial banks to hold
* no longer used by BOC

How Banks Create Money
----------------------

* MS = currency + deposits
* no banking system: all currency
* 100% reserve: all deposits
* __fractional reserve__: keep fraction of deposit as __reserve__, uses rest to make loans
* __reserve ratio, R__: fraction of deposits that banks hold as reserves
* profit from loans, money supply increase
* money supply not entirely in control of central bank
* if too much loaning, increase reserve requirement (vice versa)
* __money multiplier__: 1/R => $ generated by banking system for each $ of reserves

* __desired reserve ratio__: bank's reserves to total deposit plans to hold
* __currency drain__: leakage of reserves into currency
* __currency drain ratio__: ratio of currency to deposits

Chapter 24p2: Money Market/Quantity Theory of Money
======================================

* __quantity theory of money__

Classical Theory of Inflation
-----------------------------

* quantity theory of money explains long-term determinants of price level/inflation rate

Value of Money
--------------

* P = price level
* 1/P value of $1 measured in goods
* i.e one candy bar: P = $2 => $1 is 1/2 candy bar

Quantity Theory of Money
-----------------------

* developed by David Hume
* asserts quantity of money determines value of money 
* 2 approaches: supply-demand or equation

Money Supply
------------
* determined by Bank of Canada, banking system, consumers
* assume BOC precisely ctrls. MS

Money Demand
-------------
* rise price level => higher quantity of nominal money, doesn't change real money
* __nominal money__: amount measured in dollars
* __real money__: nominal money / price level
* demand of nominal money proportional to price level

* __nominal interest rate__: opportunity cost of holding wealth in money

* increase in real GDP increases expenditure => increases quantity of real money people plan to hold
* financial innovation lowers cost of switching between money/assets, decrease real money planned to be held

Money Market Equilibrium
------------------------

* when quantity of money demanded equals quantity supplied
* adjustments to achieve this vary long/short-term
* short-run equilibrium (see slides)
* long-run: loanable funds market determines real interest rate
* nominal interest rate = equilibrium real interest rate plus expected inflation rate
* long-run: real GDP = potential GDP, only variable to adjust: price level
* (see slides)

Adjustment Process
------------------
* increase MS causes P to rise

Real vs Nominal Variables
--------------------------

* __nominal variables__: measured in monetary units 
* __real variables__: measured in physical units
* __relative prices__: ratio between prices of two goods = real variable

Classical Dichotomy
--------------------

* theoretical separation of nominal and real values
* Hume et al. suggest monetary developments affect only nominal variables
* doubling money supply => nominal variables double, real variables remain unchanged 

The Neutrality of Money
------------------------

* proposition that changes in money supply don't affect real variables (i.e relative prices remain the same regardless of currency values)
* similarly, real wage W/P remains unchanged 

* __quantity theory of money__: proposes that in long run increase in quantity of money => equal increase in price level
* based on __velocity of circulation__ and __equation of exchange__
* velocity of circulation avg. # times in a year a dollar is used to purchase goods and services in GDP
* V = PY / M (P = price level, Y= real GDP, M=quantity of money) 
* note: PY = nominal GDP

The Quantity Equation
---------------------
* MV = PY

Quantity Theory
--------------
* V is stable
* change in M => nominal GDP change by same %
* change in M not affect Y => money is neutral, Y determined by technology/resources
* P changes by same % as PY and M
* Rapid money supply growth => rapid inflation
