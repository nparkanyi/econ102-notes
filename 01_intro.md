What is Economics?
==================

* source of all economic problems *scarcity*
* *economics*: social science: allocation of limited resources
	to satisfy unlimited human desires
* *microeconomics*: choices that individuals and businesses make
* *macroeconomics*: choices/performance of national economy

* ex: Government allocation of tax revenue

How People Make Decisions
=========================

Principle #1: People Face Tradeoffs
-----------------------------------
* all decisions involve tradeoff
* society faces important tradeoffs: *efficiency* vs *equality*

Principle #2: The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It
--------------------------------------------------------------
* decision-making: must compare costs and benefits
* *opportunity cost*: what must be given up to obtain it
* ex: university does not just cost tuition; forgone wages
* things without *explicity monetary cost* not truly 'free'; have opportunity cost

Principle #3: Rational People Think at the Margin
-------------------------------------------------
* decisions made evaluating costs and benefits of *marginal changes*; slight adjustments

Principle #4: People Respond to Incentives
------------------------------------------
* *Incentive*: something that induces a person to act
* rational people respond to incentives
* can have unexpected results: introducing seatbelt, accidents increase (people feel safer), but number 
	of deaths decreases

Principle #5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off
------------------------------------------------
* instead of self-sufficiency, specialize, produce one good/service, trade with others
* countries benefit from trade and specialization; better price for goods/services abroad

Principle #6 Markets Good Way to Organize Economic Activity
-------------------------------------------------------
* *market*: group of buyers and sellers
* organize economic activity: what to produce? how to produce them? how much? who receives?
* communism: goverment controlled organization of economic activity, low incentive
* problem with communism: low incentive
* market system: if individuals persue self-interest, interest of society maximized 
* problem with market system: monopolies (market power, set own price instead of based on supply/demand), externalities (consequences 	not of one`s doing cause market failure (under or overproduction)
* despite shortcomings, market system shown most effective

Principle #7: Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes
---------------------------------------------------------------
* inhibit monopolies: ban mergers
* enforce *property rights*

Principle #8: A country`s standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* most important factor: *productivity* (amount of goods and services produced for each hour of work)
* _gross domestic product_: total market value of everything produced within country
* GDP/capita (gross domestic product / # of inhabitants)
* productivity depends on equipment/skills/technology/etc.
* other factors (labour unions, competition from abroad) have little impact on living standards
* GDP/Capita not perfect measurements (doesn't show big picture), other factors must be considered: healthcare, child mortality rate, life expectancy, education, literacy rate, crime, fertility rate, Gini Coefficient(income disparity)
* *human development index* (HDI): composite measure made from GDP/Capita, health, education
* still, generally positive correlation between GDP/capita and these other factors, but some exceptions (Arab countries: oil wealth, high GDP/capita, but low education/political freedom)
* Sub-Saharan Africa: political corruption, too high population (population grows faster than economy), lack of education => lack of specialization => low productivity, lack technology/skills 

Principle #9: Prices rise when government Prints too Much Money
----------------------------------------------------------------
* *inflation*: increases in general level of prices
* long run, inflation coused by excessive growth in quantity of money, value falls
* Minister of Finance: responsible of keeping inflation in check
* inflation above 50%: *hyperinflation* 

Principle #10: Society Faces a Short-run Tradeoff Between Inflation and Unemployment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* *unemployed*: in the job market (looking for a job), but failing to get hired
* not unemployed if not looking for a job (i.e. stay-at-home parents)
* certain amount of inflation desirable, otherwise firms lay off workers
