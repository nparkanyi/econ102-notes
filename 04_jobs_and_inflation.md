Chapter 21
==========
* Labour force statistics:
* __employed__
* __unemployed__: looking for job, temporary layoff, waiting for start date
* __not in labour force__

* __labour force__: total number of workers, including employed and unemployed
* if you are not attempting to find a job, not considered to be in labour force

Four Labour Indicators
----------------------
* unemployment rate
* labour force participation rate
* employment-to-population ratio
* involuntary part-time

* __unemployment rate__: (# unemployed / labour force) * 100%
* __labour force participation rate__: (labour force / adult population) * 100

* __involuntary part-time rate__: percentage of labour force who work part time but want full-time jobs
* __employment-to-population rate__: percentage of the working-age population who have jobs

* __marginally attached workers__: neither working nor looking for work, but wants a job, has looked recently
* __discouraged worker__: marginally attached worker who gives up

Types of Unemployment
---------------------
* __frictional unemployment__: arises from normal laboul market turnover (creation and destruction of jobs)
* certain amount desirable; time needed to match skills to new jobs; McJobs undesirable 
* possible solution: fund job centres
* __structural unemployment__: created by changes in technology and foreign competition; lasts longer than frictional
* must be reduced by retraining
* __cyclical unemployment__: higher/lower than normal unemployment in trough/peak of business cycle

* __natural unemployment__: frictional and structural unemployment when there is no cyclical
* __full employment__: when unemployment rate equals natural unemployment rate

Factors of Natural Unemployment
-------------------------------
* age distribution
* scale of structural change
* real wage rate
* unemployment benefits

Real GDP and Unemployment Over the Cycle
---------------------------------------
* __potential GDP__: quantity of real GDP produced at full employment
* corresponds to capacity of economy to produce on sustained basis
* __output gap__: real GDP - potential GDP

Price Level, Inflation, Deflation
---------------------------------
* __CPI__ (consumer price index): number tells average price paid by urban consumers for fixed set of goods
* CPI defined as 100 for reference base period
* __inflation rate__: percentage change in price level between years

Commodity Substitution Bias
----------------------------
* prices of goods change at different rates
* consumers substitute one good for an alternative
* CPI misses this because measured goods remain constant 
* can overstate increase in cost of living

New Goods Bias
---------------
* new goods increase variety, consumers find better products, more choice
* increases value of money
* CPI misses this
* again, can overstate cost of living

Unmeasured Quality Change
-------------------------
* improvements in quality of goods increase value of each dollar

Problems With CPI
-----------------
* used to control policy on pensions/wage adjustments 
* bias in CPI may cause overadjustments 

Alternatives
------------
* __GDP deflator__
* too broad as measure of cost of living
* __chained price index for consumption (CPIC)__: index of prices of all items included in consumption expenditure of GDP
* CPIC = (nominal consumption expenditure / real consumption expenditure) * 100%

Core Inflation Rate
--------------------
* __core inflation rate__: inflation rate excluding volatile elements (food and fuel)

Correcting Variables for Inflation
----------------------------------
* when comparing over time periods, prices must be adjusted by inflation
* __price index__: shows this adjustment
* amount in today's money = amount in year T $ * (price level today / price level in year T)
* a dollar amount is __indexed__ for inflation if automatically corrected for inflation by law/contract
