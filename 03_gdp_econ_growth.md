Measuring GDP and Economic Growth
=================================

GDP
---
* __GDP__: market value of all final goods/services produced by country in a given time period
* excludes things with no market value (housework, etc.)
* __intermediate goods__: used in production of final goods, not counted in GDP
* GDP measures value of production = total expenditure on final goods = total income
* circular flow diagram: see slides
* GDP measured either by income(wages, rent, interest, profit) or expenditure(consumption, investment, government expenditure, net export)
* __transfer payments__ from gvmt: (pension, employment insurance) not counted, gvmt. gets nothing in return
* GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
* __investments__: only what's spent on intermediate products (capital)
* "Gross" means before deducting depreciation of capital
* "Net" is opposite
* __depreciation__: decrease in value of firm's capital
* __nominal GDP__: value based on current prices, not corrected for inflation
* __real GDP__: values based on prices of base year, corrected for inflation
* __GDP deflator__: = 100 (nominal / real)
* __inflation rate__ computed with % increase in GDP deflator

Measurment Shortcomings
----------------------
* doesn't count unpaid work
* underground economy
* improved product quality

Well-Being Shortcomings
-----------------------
* environment: accompanied by by-products(air, water, noise)
* leisure 
* composition and distribution of output
* non-material source of well-being
* still, indicators of quality of life generally positively correlated with GDP
